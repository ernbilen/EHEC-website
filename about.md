## About

The Electronic Health Economics Colloquium (EHEC) is a bi-weekly online health economics seminar series. The goals of EHEC are to share high-quality, new health economics research on a platform that is freely available; maintain and improve communication among health economists during a time of social distancing; and to promote equity in health economics research.

EHEC is co-organized by Shooshan Danagoulian (fr4523@wayne.edu, @Shooshan5), Ezra Golberstein (egolber@umn.edu, @EGolberstein), Sayeh Nikpay (sayeh.s.nikpay@vanderbilt.edu, @SayNikpay), and David Slusky (david.slusky@ku.edu, @DavidSlusky).
